# Jeopardy

A general purpose Jeopardy template, with a minimalist interface. Written as a webpage for ease of use.

I wrote this specific Jeopardy game with questions targeted at a beginning programmer audience, but the questions can easily be changed by editing the cc_game.js file. 

Team names can optionally be written in the red space above each team's point counter, as there is a text-box there.
